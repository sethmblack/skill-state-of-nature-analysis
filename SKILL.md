# State of Nature Analysis

Analyze any situation by imagining what would happen if the current authority structure disappeared—revealing the underlying interests, conflicts, and power dynamics that existing institutions suppress.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "What happens without authority?" about an organization, institution, or arrangement
- Analyzing situations where authority is absent, contested, or breaking down
- Evaluating the stability of current arrangements
- Understanding what forces existing institutions are containing
- Request for "power vacuum analysis" or "authority collapse scenario"
- Assessing the true source of stability in any system

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Description of current situation, organization, or institution |
| authority_structure | No | Who currently holds power and how (will be inferred if not provided) |
| key_parties | No | Major stakeholders whose interests are relevant |

## The Five-Step Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Current Leviathan

Map the existing authority structure:
- Who holds sovereign power in this domain?
- What decisions does this authority control?
- What enforcement mechanisms back this authority?
- How did this authority come to exist?

**Hobbes's insight:** Every stable arrangement has some power maintaining it, even if that power is obscured or informal.

### Step 2: Enumerate the Suppressed Conflicts

Identify what conflicts the current authority prevents or contains:
- What would parties fight over if no one could enforce rules?
- What competing claims exist beneath the surface?
- What resentments or ambitions does the current order suppress?
- Who benefits and who chafes under current arrangements?

**Hobbes's insight:** "In the nature of man, we find three principal causes of quarrel: competition, diffidence, and glory."

### Step 3: Apply the Thought Experiment

Remove the authority mentally and trace the consequences:
- If this authority disappeared tomorrow, what would happen first?
- Who would move to fill the vacuum?
- What coalitions would form?
- What resources would become contested?
- How would competition escalate without an arbiter?

**Hobbes's insight:** Without a common power to keep them in awe, humans return to the war of all against all.

### Step 4: Assess the State of Nature Severity

Evaluate how bad the power vacuum would be:
- **Mild:** Clear successor or quick reconstitution likely
- **Moderate:** Period of instability before new order emerges
- **Severe:** Prolonged conflict with uncertain resolution
- **Catastrophic:** Full Hobbesian state of nature—all against all

Consider:
- Are parties roughly equal in capability (maximizes conflict)?
- Are there scarce resources worth fighting over?
- Does anyone have sufficient power to impose order?
- Are there shared norms that might constrain behavior?

### Step 5: Identify What Actually Maintains Order

Conclude by identifying the true sources of current stability:
- Is it legitimate authority, fear, or exhaustion?
- What would change that would undermine current stability?
- Where is the system most fragile?
- What "covenants" are held only by the sword?

**Hobbes's insight:** Understand not just that order exists, but why it exists—and therefore when it might fail.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## State of Nature Analysis

### Current Authority Structure
[Description of who holds power and how]

### Suppressed Conflicts
| Conflict | Parties | Currently Contained By |
|----------|---------|------------------------|
| [Description] | [Who vs. whom] | [What prevents it] |

### Authority Removal Scenario
**Immediate effects:** [What happens first]
**Secondary dynamics:** [How situation evolves]
**Likely outcome:** [Where it stabilizes or doesn't]

### Severity Assessment
**Rating:** [Mild/Moderate/Severe/Catastrophic]
**Rationale:** [Why this rating—equality of parties, resources at stake, etc.]

### True Sources of Stability
- [What actually maintains current order]
- [What would destabilize it]

### Conclusion
[Clear statement of the power dynamics revealed by this analysis]
```

## Constraints

- Do not assume stability is natural or self-sustaining
- Do not confuse legitimate authority with effective authority
- Do not ignore enforcement mechanisms just because they're not exercised
- Acknowledge when current order depends on contingent factors
- Be specific about which "wars" would emerge—vague conflict is not analysis

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Our startup has three co-founders with equal equity. Analyze the power structure."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## State of Nature Analysis

### Current Authority Structure
Three co-founders hold equal equity (33.3% each), suggesting no clear sovereign. However, effective authority often differs from formal structure. Key questions: Who controls the bank account? Who can fire employees? Who do investors contact? Equal equity creates the illusion of equal power while obscuring actual decision-making.

### Suppressed Conflicts
| Conflict | Parties | Currently Contained By |
|----------|---------|------------------------|
| Strategic direction | All three, different visions | Shared excitement and external pressure to present unity |
| Resource allocation (whose projects get funded) | Each founder's domain | Informal norms, avoiding the conversation |
| Who speaks for the company | All three, different styles | Investor relationships not yet formalized |
| Who can be removed | All three, different contributions | No mechanism exists; no one wants to discover the answer |

### Authority Removal Scenario
If one founder departed or a major strategic disagreement emerged:

**Immediate effects:**
- 2v1 coalition forms (or attempts to)
- The "1" contests the 2's authority to decide
- No mechanism exists to resolve the dispute
- Operations pause as each founder questions others' decisions

**Secondary dynamics:**
- Employees forced to choose sides
- Investors approached by factions seeking support
- Legal review of operating agreement (likely vague)
- Deadlock on any decision requiring consensus

**Likely outcome:**
- Either: One founder leaves (voluntarily or not), creating clarity
- Or: Deadlock forces dissolution or fire sale
- Rarely: Return to cooperation (suppressed conflict will resurface)

### Severity Assessment
**Rating:** Severe
**Rationale:**
- Parties are exactly equal in formal power (maximizes conflict per Hobbes)
- No tie-breaker mechanism exists
- Resources (company equity, reputation) are significant and indivisible
- No superior authority to impose resolution

### True Sources of Stability
- **Current stability depends on:** Shared goal of company success, avoidance of conflict, external pressure to present unity
- **Stability would fail if:** A major strategic decision forces disagreement, or one founder's contribution becomes clearly less valuable
- **The sword that keeps peace:** Fear that conflict destroys the company (and their equity)

### Conclusion
This is a textbook Hobbesian trap. Equal sovereignty is no sovereignty—when these founders disagree on something that matters, they will discover they have no mechanism to decide. The current peace exists because they haven't faced a decision worth fighting over, or because they've been avoiding those decisions. The company needs a designated sovereign for deadlocks: a board, a tiebreaker clause, or explicit domains where each has final authority. "We'll work it out" is not governance—it's the treaty that holds only until someone decides it's worth breaking.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Thomas Hobbes** expert persona. Use it when you need to reveal the power dynamics beneath apparent stability by asking: what happens when the authority disappears?
